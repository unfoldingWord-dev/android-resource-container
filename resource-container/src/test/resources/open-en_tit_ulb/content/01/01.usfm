  <verse number="1" style="v" />I, Paul, write this letter. </para>

<para style="p">This is Paul, who is a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I work to help God's people trust him more. God chose us all to be his people and I work to help them truly know how to live in a way that pleases God.

  <verse number="2" style="v" />His people can learn how to live like this, because they are confident that God will cause them to live forever. God tells no lies. Even before the world began, he promised to cause us to live forever.

  <verse number="3" style="v" />Then, at the right time, he made his word plain for all to understand because he trusted me to preach this message. I do this in order to obey the command of God, who saves us.
