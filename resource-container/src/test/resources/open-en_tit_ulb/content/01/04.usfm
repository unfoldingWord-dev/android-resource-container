  <verse number="4" style="v" />I am writing to you, Titus, because you are like a son to me because we both believe in Jesus Christ. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior continue to be kind to you and to give you peace.

  <verse number="5" style="v" />I left you on the Island of Crete for this reason; that you do the work that has been unfinished and also appoint elders for the group of believers in every city, just as I told you to do.
