  <verse number="4" style="v" />But when God showed us that he was acting to save all people because he loves them, 

  <verse number="5" style="v" />he saved us by washing us clean on the inside, giving us a new birth, and making us new by the Holy Spirit. He did not save us because we do good things, but he saved us because he is merciful.
