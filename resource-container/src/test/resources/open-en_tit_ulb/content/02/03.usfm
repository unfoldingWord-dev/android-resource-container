  <verse number="3" style="v" />The older women, like the men, should live so that everyone knows that they respect God very much. They must not say bad things about other people, and they must not drink very much wine. But they should teach others what is good.

  <verse number="4" style="v" />In this way, they should teach the younger women to think wisely and to love their own husbands and children.

  <verse number="5" style="v" />The older women should also teach the younger women to think good thoughts, not to act in a bad way toward any man, to work well at home, and to do what their husbands tell them. They should do all these things so that no one will mock God's word.
